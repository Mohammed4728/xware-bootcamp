    <p>an Argentine professional footballer who plays as a forward for and captains both Major League Soccer club Inter Miami and the Argentina national team. Widely regarded as one of the greatest players of all time, Messi has won a record eight Ballon d'Or awards, a record six European Golden Shoes, and was named the world's best player for a record eight times by FIFA.[note 2] Messi is the most decorated player in the history of professional football, with 45 senior titles. Until 2021, he had spent his entire professional career with Barcelona, where he won a club-record 34 trophies, including ten La Liga titles, seven Copa del Rey titles, and the UEFA Champions League four times. With his country, he won two Copa América titles and the 2022 FIFA World Cup.</p>

    <span><b><ins>Family and relationships</ins></b></span>
    <p>Since 2008, Messi has been in a relationship with Antonela Roccuzzo, a fellow native of Rosario.[225] He has known Roccuzzo since he was five years old, as she is the cousin of his childhood best friend, Lucas Scaglia, who is also a football player.[226] After keeping their relationship private for a year, Messi first confirmed their romance in an interview in January 2009, before going public a month later during a carnival in Sitges after the Barcelona–Espanyol derby.[227]</p>
    <p>Messi and Roccuzzo have three sons. To celebrate his partner's first pregnancy, Messi placed the ball under his shirt after scoring in Argentina's 4–0 win against Ecuador on 2 June 2012, before confirming the pregnancy in an interview two weeks later.[229] Thiago was born in Barcelona on 2 November 2012.[230] In April 2015, Messi confirmed that they were expecting another child.[231] On 30 June 2017, he married Roccuzzo at a luxury hotel named Hotel City Center in Rosario.[232] In October 2017, his wife announced they were expecting their third child.[233] Messi and his family are Catholic Christians.[234]</p>

    <span><b><ins>Comparisons with Cristiano Ronaldo</ins></b></span>
    <p>Among his contemporary peers, Messi is most often compared and contrasted with Portuguese forward Cristiano Ronaldo, as part of an ongoing rivalry that has been compared to past sports rivalries like the Muhammad Ali–Joe Frazier rivalry in boxing, the Prost–Senna rivalry in motorsport, and the tennis rivalries between Federer–Nadal and Borg–McEnroe.</p>
    <p>Although Messi has at times denied any rivalry,[164][165] they are widely believed to push one another in their aim to be the best player in the world.[166] Since 2008, Messi has won eight Ballons d'Or to Ronaldo's five,[167] eight FIFA World's Best Player awards to Ronaldo's five, and six European Golden Shoes to Ronaldo's four.[168] Pundits and fans regularly argue the individual merits of both players.[166][169] Beyond their playing styles, the debate also revolves around their differing physiques – Ronaldo is 1.87 m (6 ft 1+1⁄2 in) with a muscular build – and contrasting public personalities with Ronaldo's self-confidence and theatrics a foil to Messi's humility.[170][171][172] From 2009–10 to 2017–18, Messi faced Ronaldo at least twice every season in El Clásico, which ranks among the world's most viewed annual sports events.[173] Off the pitch, Ronaldo is his direct competitor in terms of salary, sponsorships, and social media fanbase.</p>
